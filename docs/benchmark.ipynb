    "## One featurizer to rule them all?\n",
    "Contrary to many other machine learning domains, _molecular_ featurization (i.e. the process of transforming a molecule into a vector) lacks a good default. It remains unclear how we can effectively capture the richness of molecular data in a unified representation and what works best heavily depends on the nature and constraints of the task you are trying to model. It is therefore good practice to try different featurization schemes: From structural fingerprints, to physico-chemical descriptors and pre-trained embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Don't take our word for it\n",
    "To demonstrate the impact a featurizer can have, we setup two simple benchmarks.\n",
    "1. To demonstrate the impact on modeling, we will use two datasets from [MoleculeNet](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1).\n",
    "2. To demonstrate the impact on search, we will use the [RDKit Benchmarking Platform](https://github.com/rdkit/benchmarking_platform).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compare the performance of three different featurizers:\n",
    "- **ECFP6** [1]: Binary, circular fingerprints where each bit indicates the presence of particular substructures of a radius up to 3 bonds away from an atom.\n",
    "- **Mordred** [2]: Continuous descriptors with more than 1800 2D and 3D descriptors.\n",
    "- **ChemBERTa** [3]: Learned representations from a pre-trained SMILES transformer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling\n",
    "We will compare the performance on two datasets using scikit-learn [AutoML](https://github.com/automl/auto-sklearn) [4, 5] models."
